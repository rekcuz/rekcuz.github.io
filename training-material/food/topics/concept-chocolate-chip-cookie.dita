<section id="section_cwc_mqb_wnb">The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and
both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Variations include recipes with other
types of chocolate or additional ingredients, such as nuts or oatmeal or cannibis.</section>

   <title>Origination</title>
   <p>The chocolate chip cookie was accidentally developed by Ruth Graves Wakefield in 1930. She
    owned the Toll House Inn, in Whitman, Massachusetts, a very popular restaurant that featured
    home cooking in the 1930s. Her cookbook, <i>Toll House Tried and True Recipes</i>, was published
    in 1936 by M. Barrows; Company, New York. It included the recipe "Toll House Chocolate Crunch
    Cookie", which rapidly became a favorite to be baked in American homes.</p>

<section otherprops="nestle"><title>Nestleâ€™s History of the Cookie</title
><p>Wakefield is said to have been making chocolate cookies and on
running out of regular baker's chocolate, substituted broken pieces
of semi-sweet chocolate from Nestle thinking that they would melt
and mix into the batter. They did not and the chocolate chip cookie
was born. Wakefield sold the recipe to Nestle in exchange for a lifetime
supply of chocolate chips. Every bag of Nestle chocolate chips sold
in North America has a variation of her original recipe printed on
the back. </p><p>During WWII, US soldiers from Massachusetts who were
stationed overseas shared the cookies they received in care packages
from back home with soldiers from other parts of the US. Soon, hundreds
of soldiers were writing home asking their families to send them some
Toll House cookies, and Wakefield was soon inundated with letters
from around the world asking for her recipe. Thus began the nationwide
craze for the chocolate chip cookie.</p></section>
